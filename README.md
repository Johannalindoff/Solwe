# Solwe

🌏 💫 This code is a part of team Bredvid's contribution to the Hackathon NASA Space App Challenge. It shows how an IOS app can connect and interact with the NASA POWER API. The NASA POWER website provides solar and meteorological data sets from NASA research and this app is supposed to use this data in a solar panel application. The user to the app is supposed to compare its energy production from the solar panels with data about available sunlight from NASA. This app shows how to handle the data from the API in a very simple way.
